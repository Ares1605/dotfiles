## Important rules
* Build modular first. Try not to build code files longer than 500 lines of code! Documentation, plans etc. can be as long as needed, but code files must be modular. 
* Think ahead! Do not write code that you know will need to be changed later without planning for that change now. So keep entrypoints stable and isolate logic into smaller modules from the start!
* Do not limit yourself due to the LOC limit! If a task requires more code, split it into multiple files/modules/functions
* Do not add default fallbacks during development phase. Is something fails, let it fail, so we can fix it! Avoid excessive defensive programming
* Do not leavy empty try-catch blocks anywhere!
* Do not reinvent the wheel! Use open source, self-hosted libraries when needed. Ask the user, and help them qualify their selection. 

## Important rules
* When creating or modifying PHP endpoints, consider using or adding core files (/shared/core/[class name].php) that the endpoint can use, so endpoints are more modularized, readable, and testable.
